### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 2 was a favorite because I created a game. I was able to capture user inputs and utilize them to create the game with an if statement. I was also able to output a message depending on if the guessed number was correct, higher, or lower.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was a favorite because I thought it was fun to fill in the mad libs. The topic of sandwiches also contributed to my enjoyment of this lab. I was able to determine whether or not there were enough arguments for the program to be fulfilled. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 part 2 was a favorite because I revisited the topic of a previous lab. Exploring a different way to make the guessing game helped me see a different way to reach a similar outcome. I was able to write code in order to create a random secret number for the user to guess.
